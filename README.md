# 📊 Age Statistics Explorer

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my **first data analysis project** where I explored the distribution of students’ ages.
The project applies basic **descriptive statistics** and **data visualization** to understand the dataset better.

## 🔎 What I Did
- Built a **frequency distribution table** (absolute, relative, cumulative).
- Calculated key statistical measures:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Range
- Visualized the results using:
  - 📊 Bar Chart
  - 🥧 Pie Chart

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student performance data, with **Age** being the main focus in this project.

## 🚀 Results
- Clear understanding of how ages are distributed among students.
- Learned how to calculate and visualize descriptive statistics using Python.
- Built my **first complete EDA project**.
